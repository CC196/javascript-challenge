# ALIENS-R-REAL
# Try to find an UFO?
There is a page in `level-1` that can find any UFO eye-witness report in the date you want to know(if exist).
# Want to find the UFO base on more detail?
There is a page in `level-2` for you! you can enter one or more of `date`,`city`,`state`,`country`, and `shape` as filter.
## How it work.
There is a filter buttom in the page that will get the input that you type. The javascript will go through the data and find the match eye-witness report. In the level-2 there multiple input fields, you will need to input at least one to find the eye-witness reports. In the javascript, it will filter the data one-by-one base on inputs, however if there any input is not match, the result will be NaN.
